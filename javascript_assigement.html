        default:
            console.log("no fruits");
    }

(19).What is the use of is Nan function?
The isNaN function in JavaScript is used to determine whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number) or not. It returns true if the value passed to it is NaN, and false otherwise. The isNaN function is often used to validate user input, especially when the input is expected to be a number, to avoid errors and unexpected behavior in the code.
For example:
console.log(isNaN(123));  // false
console.log(isNaN("Hello"));  // true

(20).What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?
&& := The && operator is known as the logical AND operator. It returns true if both the conditions on either side of the operator are true. If either of the conditions is false, it returns false.
console.log(true && true); // true
console.log(true && false); // false
console.log(false && true); // false
console.log(false && false); // false

|| := The || operator is known as the logical OR operator. It returns true if at least one of the conditions on either side of the o.
console.log(true || true); // true
console.log(true || false); // true
console.log(false || true); // true
console.log(false || false); // false

(21).What is the use of Void (0)?
The void(0) expression is a common technique used in JavaScript to prevent the default behavior of a page element, such as a link. When a link is clicked, it typically causes the browser to navigate to a different page. By using void(0) as the value of the href attribute, the default behavior of the link is cancelled, and the navigation is prevented.
Here's an example:
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="alert('Hello World');">Click Me</a>
In this example, the void(0) expression is used in the href attribute of the link to prevent the default behavior of the link. When the link is clicked, the onclick event is triggered and an alert box with the message "Hello World" is displayed.
The void(0) expression is equivalent to undefined and is used because it's a concise way to return undefined as the result of an expression. By returning undefined, the expression has no effect on the web page and prevents the default behavior of the page element.

•What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for client-side web development to create interactive effects within a web browser. It is also used for server-side development using Node.js and for creating native mobile apps using technologies such as React Native. JavaScript is an object-oriented, dynamic and flexible language that is easy to learn and is used to add interactivity and other dynamic elements to websites.

•What is the use of isNaN function?
The isNaN function in JavaScript is used to determine whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number) or not. It returns true if the value passed to it is NaN, and false otherwise. The isNaN function is often used to validate user input, especially when the input is expected to be a number, to avoid errors and unexpected behavior in the code.
For example:
console.log(isNaN(123));  // false
console.log(isNaN("Hello"));  // true

•What is negative Infinity?
In JavaScript, -Infinity represents negative infinity, which is a numeric value that represents a quantity that is less than negative infinity. This value is obtained by dividing a negative number by zero. -Infinity is a special value in the JavaScript language and is used to represent the result of certain mathematical operations, such as when the result of a calculation is smaller than the smallest representable number.
For example:
console.log(1 / -0);  // -Infinity

•Which company developed JavaScript?
JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation in the mid-1990s as a scripting language for web browsers. It was created by Brendan Eich, who was a programmer at Netscape at the time. JavaScript was initially called Mocha and was later changed to Livescript before finally being named JavaScript. JavaScript quickly became popular due to its versatility and ability to add interactivity and dynamic elements to websites, and it is now an essential technology for front-end web development.

•What are undeclared and undefined variables?
In JavaScript, variables must be declared using the var, let, or const keywords before they can be used in the code.
An undeclared variable is a variable that has not been declared using one of these keywords and is therefore not recognized by the JavaScript interpreter. Attempting to use an undeclared variable will result in a reference error.
An undefined variable, on the other hand, is a variable that has been declared using one of the keywords, but has not been assigned a value. The value of an undefined variable is undefined.
For example:
// undeclared variable
console.log(x);  // Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined
// undefined variable
var y;

•Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?
There are several ways to dynamically add new elements to a web page using JavaScript, here are a few common ones:
1.	Using innerHTML property: You can use the innerHTML property to dynamically add new elements to an existing HTML element.
// select the target element
var target = document.getElementById("target");
// add a new element
target.innerHTML = "<p>This is a new paragraph.</p>";
2.	Using the createElement and appendChild methods: You can use the createElement method to create a new HTML element, and the appendChild method to add it to an existing element.
// select the target element
var target = document.getElementById("target");

// create a new element
var newElement = document.createElement("p");
newElement.innerHTML = "This is a new paragraph.";

// add the new element to the target
target.appendChild(newElement);
3.	Using the insertAdjacentHTML method: You can use the insertAdjacentHTML method to add new HTML elements to an existing element.
// select the target element
var target = document.getElementById("target");
// add a new element
target.insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend", "<p>This is a new paragraph.</p>");

•What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
ViewState and SessionState are both mechanisms used to store data on the server in a web application. However, they differ in their scope, lifetime, and use case.
ViewState is a mechanism used to store the state of a web page between postbacks. It is used to retain values of controls on the page, such as text boxes, drop-down lists, and other user inputs, between postbacks. The data is stored as a hidden field in the HTML of the page and is sent back and forth between the client and server with each request and response. The lifetime of ViewState data is limited to the life of the current page and is lost when the user navigates to another page.
SessionState, on the other hand, is a mechanism used to store data that is specific to a particular user session. It is used to store data that needs to persist across multiple page requests and multiple postbacks during a user session. The data is stored on the server and can be accessed from any page in the application. The lifetime of SessionState data is maintained for the duration of the user session, which is typically established when the user logs in and lasts until the user logs out or their session times out.
 ViewState is used to sto
 re data specific to a single web page, while SessionState is used to store data specific to a user session that needs to persist across multiple pages.

•What is === operator?
The === operator in JavaScript is known as the strict equality operator. It compares two values for equality and returns true if the values are equal and false otherwise. Unlike the equality operator ==, the strict equality operator === performs type coercion. That means it compares values after converting both operands to the same type.
For example:
console.log(1 === 1);         // true
console.log("1" === 1);       // false
console.log(true === 1);      // false
console.log(null === undefined); // false

•How can the style/class of an element be changed?
JavaScript, you can change the style or class of an HTML element in several ways:
1.	Using the style property: You can directly access the style property of an element and set its CSS properties.
// select the element
var element = document.getElementById("target");

// change the style of the element
element.style.backgroundColor = "red";
element.style.height = "100px";
element.style.width = "100px";
2.	Using the className property: You can access the className property of an element and set it to the class name you want to apply. This will change the styles applied to the element using the specified class in your CSS.
// select the element
var element = document.getElementById("target");

// change the class of the element
element.className = "new-class";
3.	Using the setAttribute method: You can use the setAttribute method to add or modify the class attribute of an element.
// select the element
var element = document.getElementById("target");

// change the class of the element
element.setAttribute("class", "new-class");
These are just a few ways to change the style or class of an element in JavaScript. The method you choose will depend on your specific requirements and the structure of your HTML and CSS.

•What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
1.	for loop: The for loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly a specific number of times. The syntax for a for loop is:
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
  // code to be executed
}
Here's an example:
for (var i = 0; i< 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
This will log the numbers 0 to 4 to the console.
2.	while loop: The while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. The syntax for a while loop is:
while (condition) {
  // code to be executed
}
Here's an example:
var i = 0;
while (i< 5) {
  console.log(i);
i++;
}
This will log the numbers 0 to 4 to the console.
Additionally, there's also the do...while loop, which is similar to the while loop, but the code in the loop will be executed at least once, even if the condition is false. The syntax for a do...while loop is:
do {
  // code to be executed
} while (condition);

These are the main
 looping structures in JavaScript. Loops are useful for repeating operations, and they are a fundamental part of most programming languages.

•How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?
JavaScript, you can use the parseInt function to convert a string representation of a number in any base to an integer. The parseInt function takes two arguments: the string to be converted, and the base of the string representation (optional, defaults to base 10).
Here's an example:
const binaryString = "1010";
const decimal = parseInt(binaryString, 2);
console.log(decimal); // Output: 10

•What is the function of the delete operator?
The delete operator is used in JavaScript to remove properties from objects. The delete operator takes an object property as its operand and, if the property is deletable, removes the property and returns true. If the property is not deletable or doesn't exist, the delete operator returns false.
Here's an example:
let obj = { name: "John", age: 30 };

delete obj.age;
console.log(obj); // Output: { name: "John" }

delete obj.gender;
console.log(obj); // Output: { name: "John" }

•What is the use of Void (0)?
he void(0) expression is a common technique used in JavaScript to prevent the default behavior of a page element, such as a link. When a link is clicked, it typically causes the browser to navigate to a different page. By using void(0) as the value of the href attribute, the default behavior of the link is cancelled, and the navigation is prevented.
Here's an example:
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="alert('Hello World');">Click Me</a>
In this example, the void(0) expression is used in the href attribute of the link to prevent the default behavior of the link. When the link is clicked, the onclick event is triggered and an alert box with the message "Hello World" is displayed.
The void(0) expression is equivalent to undefined and is used because it's a concise way to return undefined as the result of an expression. By returning undefined, the expression has no effect on the web page and prevents the default behavior of the page element.

•How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, you can use the window.location object to force a page to load another page. The window.location object has a property called href that can be used to set the URL of the page to be loaded.
Here's an example:
window.location.href = "https://www.example.com";
In this example, the window.location.href property is set to the URL "https://www.example.com", which causes the current page to navigate to the specified URL.
You can also use the window.location.replace method to load another page, which replaces the current page in the history stack and prevents the user from navigating back to the previous page using the browser's back button.
Here's an example:
window.location.replace("https://www.example.com");
In this example, the window.location.replace method is used to load the URL "https://www.example.com", which replaces the current page in the history stack and prevents the user from navigating back to the previous page.

•What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
1.	Security Concerns: Using innerHTML to insert dynamic content from untrusted sources can result in security vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
2.	Performance Issues: Modifying the innerHTML property can be slow, especially for larger amounts of content, as the browser must re-render the entire contents of the element.
3.	Inconsistent Behavior: Different browsers may have different implementations of the innerHTML property, leading to inconsistent behavior and difficulties with cross-browser compatibility.
4.	Difficult to maintain code: Modifying the contents of an element using innerHTML can result in a cluttered and difficult-to-maintain codebase.
5.	Lack of Separation of Concerns: Using innerHTML to manipulate the DOM tightly couples the structure of the HTML and the behavior of the JavaScript code, making it harder to maintain and test.
